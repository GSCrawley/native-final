# native-final

### while I still haven't settled on a specific project, i'm looking at open source React Native packages on https://awesomeopensource.com for packages i may want to incorporate into my project. 

react-native-scrollable-tab-view
npm version

This is probably my favorite navigation pattern on Android, I wish it were more common on iOS! This is a very simple JavaScript-only implementation of it for React Native. For more information about how the animations behind this work, check out the Rebound section of the React Native Animation Guide

Add it to your project
Run npm install react-native-scrollable-tab-view --save
var ScrollableTabView = require('react-native-scrollable-tab-view');

### project is likely going to use three.js and possibly ARKit with React Native. For my winter intensive redo i was going to do an AR App so maybe i'll incorporate that into this project so as to kill two birds with one stone
