# native-final

### while I still haven't settled on a specific project, i'm looking at open source React Native packages on https://awesomeopensource.com for packages i may want to incorporate into my project. 

### project is likely going to use three.js and possibly ARKit with React Native. For my winter intensive redo i was going to do an AR App so maybe i'll incorporate that into this project so as to kill two birds with one stone
